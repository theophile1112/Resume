<h2>Summary and Objectives</h2>
<h3>Experienced real estate investment professional, seeking to transition into IT development</h3>
<p>After 10 years of experience in the real estate industry in Western Europe (France and Luxembourg), I decided to move to Bulgaria due to the strictness of Covid restrictions in Luxembourg. In 2022, while I was enjoying my job as a Real Estate Asset Manager, Luxembourg's government decided to require Covid tests or vaccine certificates to enter company premises. I decided to leave the country as this was unacceptable to me.</p>

<p>Once in Bulgaria, I quickly found a job as a Customer Support Agent. I stayed in this position for a year before finding a better one as a real estate analyst in a French company that moved some teams to Sofia to save costs. This job is more convenient because, unlike being a Customer Support Agent, I don't have night or weekend shifts, only standard office hours. However, it's still very boring compared to what I am capable of doing, considering my previous experiences in Western Europe.</p>

<p>To have better job opportunities in Bulgaria, and perhaps to work from anywhere as a freelance developer, I recently decided to learn coding. I am currently taking an online course from The App Brewery via Udemy, and I have also started a Python course. I am really motivated to learn new skills.</p>

<p>I have always enjoyed developing Excel models with complex formulas, and I believe that I have a logical mindset, which will help me become proficient in programming. I am already thinking about tools that I could build to help companies in the real estate investment industry. And if they are not good enough to sell, it will still be a good way to practice!</p>
